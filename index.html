            Fresh off the assembly lines and into the market, we bring to you the Charger SuperBank. This beast of a battery is an external power source on another level. 
            Where most power banks hold 6000mAh and can fit in your pocket, the SuperBank holds over 100,000mAh and is the size of a small dog.
            Not only does it outweigh other power banks, but it also runs circles around them it versatility. This puppy (again, it's the size of one) includes 5 AC power sockets, 2 of them come complete with grounds as well.
